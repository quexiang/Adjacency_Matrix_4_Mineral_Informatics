[Adjacency matrix 4 Mineral Informatics](https://quexiang.shinyapps.io/Adjacency_Matrix_4_Mineral_Informatics/)  for quick exploring hidden patterns in mineral data.  

- You may find interesting patterns in the adjacency matrix. When you select an element in the Periodic Table, if it is one of the ore-forming elements. The adjacency matrix corresponding to the element will appear at the bottom of the page. You can reorder the matrix by selecting different metric.

- We reused the periodic table from this  [project](https://www.codedrome.com/interactive-periodic-table-in-javascript) 

- The DataExtration_Cleaning folder contains codes for data cleaning.

- The "MED_export.csv" file can be obtained [via](https://rruff.info/mineral_list/MED/exporting/)
