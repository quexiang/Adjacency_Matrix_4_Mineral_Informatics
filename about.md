### About
adjacency matrix for quick exploring patterns in mineral data. 

Cells of the adjacency matrix represent edges, their source and target nodes arranged along the x and y axes.
Here, the cells are colored based on their nodes' community membership - those that share a community are colored, while those that connect across two different communities are gray.

Some of the datasets have weigted edges - you may optionally set the alpha level of the plot to correspond to these weights.
